# Following_Asabeneth_30_Days_Of_Pyhton

As the title says, I'm following Asabeneth 30 Days of Python.

This repository contains my notes and my solutions to the exercises.
On the first days I wasn't completing the exercises because they were basically typing again almost everything that I tiped during my notes.
Please be advise that, even though my solutions to the exercises work, they are most probably not optimized cause I'm just learning so.. it is what it is! ;)

I have started this repository after finishing Day 10. 
Better late than never! ;P
